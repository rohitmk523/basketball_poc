   "source": "# Basketball Video Analysis POC with Tracking Integration\n## Automated Event Detection and Processing Pipeline\n\nThis notebook implements a comprehensive basketball video analysis system that:\n- Processes tracking-enhanced basketball videos (from tracking preprocessor)\n- Detects key events: 2pt/3pt shots, assists, steals, blocks\n- Uses tracking data to improve event detection accuracy\n- Uses Gemini Pro 2.5 for video understanding and event extraction\n- Generates structured JSON outputs and annotated videos\n\n### Enhanced Architecture Overview\n1. **Input**: Tracking-enhanced videos from basketball_tracking_preprocessor.ipynb\n2. **Video Segmentation**: Split videos into 30-second processable chunks using FFmpeg\n3. **VLM Analysis**: Gemini Pro 2.5 analyzes tracking-enriched video segments\n4. **Event Synthesis**: Enhanced event detection with player position context\n5. **Output Generation**: Creates JSON reports and timeline video overlays\n\n### New Features:\n- **Tracking Integration**: Uses videos with player/ball tracking overlays\n- **Enhanced Context**: Gemini analyzes videos with visible player movements\n- **Improved Accuracy**: Better event detection with tracking visual cues\n- **Optional Tracking Data**: Can optionally use JSON tracking data for validation"

Player deflecting/stopping/swatting opponent's shot attempt\n2. **REBOUNDS** - Player grabbing the ball after a missed shot (offensive or defensive)\n3. **2PT_SHOTS** - Shots taken INSIDE the 3-point arc (layups, dunks, mid-range shots, floaters, hook shots, paint shots, pull-up jumpers from inside the arc)\n4. **SHOTS** - Shots taken from BEYOND the 3-point arc (only use this for 3-point attempts, corner threes, deep shots)\n5. **STEALS** - Player taking possession of the ball from opponent (strips, intercepts, pokes away)\n6. **ASSISTS** - Passes that directly lead to a successful basket within 2 seconds\n\n**ENHANCED DETECTION WITH TRACKING:**\n- Use bounding boxes to identify specific players making plays\n- Follow ball tracking to see shot trajectories and outcomes\n- Use movement trails to identify assists (pass leading to immediate score)\n- Track player positions to distinguish 2pt vs 3pt shot locations\n- Watch for defensive actions like blocks and steals using player movement\n\n**CRITICAL DETECTION RULES:**\n- Look for SUCCESSFUL shots (ball goes in) vs MISSED shots (ball doesn't go in)\n- Pay attention to WHERE the shot is taken from (inside vs outside 3-point line)\n- Watch for blocks - when a defender stops a shot attempt\n- Notice assists - passes that immediately lead to a made basket\n- Identify steals - when possession changes due to defensive action\n\n**SHOT OUTCOME DETECTION:**\n- \"made\" = ball goes through the hoop successfully\n- \"missed\" = shot attempt that doesn't go in\n- Use ball tracking to follow the trajectory and outcome\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT (use exactly this format):**\nTIMESTAMP: [X.X]s\nEVENT: [block/rebound/shot/steal/2pt_shot/assist]\nOUTCOME: [made/missed/N/A]\nDESCRIPTION: [specific description including player identification from tracking boxes and what happened]\nCONFIDENCE: [7-10]\nLOCATION: [specific court position - paint, mid-range, corner three, etc.]\n---\n\n**EXAMPLES with tracking context:**\nTIMESTAMP: 5.2s\nEVENT: 2pt_shot\nOUTCOME: made\nDESCRIPTION: Player with tracking box makes a pull-up jumper from just inside the three-point line, ball tracking shows successful trajectory\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nLOCATION: mid-range\n---\n\nTIMESTAMP: 12.5s\nEVENT: block\nOUTCOME: N/A\nDESCRIPTION: Defensive player with red tracking box blocks layup attempt, clear defensive action visible in tracking\nCONFIDENCE: 8\nLOCATION: paint\n---\n\nTIMESTAMP: 18.3s\nEVENT: assist\nOUTCOME: N/A\nDESCRIPTION: Player passes to teammate (visible in movement trails), immediate score follows with clear ball tracking path\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nLOCATION: right wing\n---\n\nWatch the ENTIRE segment carefully and use the tracking visual overlays to provide more accurate event detection with precise timestamps and outcomes. The tracking information should help you identify players and ball movements more clearly.\"\"\"\n    \n# Re-initialize analyzer with enhanced version\nif config.GEMINI_API_KEY:\n    gemini_analyzer = GeminiVideoAnalyzer(config.GEMINI_API_KEY, config.GEMINI_MODEL)\n    print(\"✅ Enhanced Gemini Video Analyzer with tracking-enhanced video support initialized\")\nelse:\n    print(\"⚠️  Gemini API key required to initialize analyzer\")"
