    "This notebook implements a comprehensive basketball video analysis system that:\n",
    "- Processes 15-minute basketball video clips\n",
    "- Detects key events: 2pt/3pt shots, assists, steals, blocks\n",
    "- Generates structured JSON outputs and annotated videos\n",
    "- Uses Gemini Pro 2.5 for video understanding and event extraction\n",
    "- Uses FFmpeg for robust video processing\n",

    "2. **VLM Analysis**: Gemini Pro 2.5 generates dense captions for each chunk\n",
    "3. **Event Synthesis**: LLM cleans and structures events into final logs\n",
