    "This notebook implements a comprehensive basketball video analysis system that:\n",
    "- Processes 15-minute basketball video clips\n",
    "- Detects key events: 2pt/3pt shots, assists, steals, blocks\n",
    "- Generates structured JSON outputs and annotated videos\n",
    "- Uses Gemini Pro 2.5 for video understanding and event extraction\n",
    "- Uses FFmpeg for robust video processing\n",

    "1. **Video Segmentation**: Split videos into 30-second processable chunks using FFmpeg\n",
    "2. **VLM Analysis**: Gemini Pro 2.5 generates dense captions for each chunk\n",
    "3. **Event Synthesis**: LLM cleans and structures events into final logs\n",

    "1. **BLOCKS** - Player deflecting/stopping/swatting opponent's shot attempt\n",
    "2. **2PT_SHOTS** - Shots taken INSIDE the 3-point arc (layups, dunks, mid-range shots, floaters, hook shots, paint shots, pull-up jumpers from inside the arc)\n",
    "3. **SHOTS** - Shots taken from BEYOND the 3-point arc (only use this for 3-point attempts, corner threes, deep shots)\n",

    "5. **ASSISTS** - Passes that directly lead to a successful basket within 2 seconds\n",

    "- Pay attention to WHERE the shot is taken from (inside vs outside 3-point line)\n",
    "- Watch for blocks - when a defender stops a shot attempt ON EITHER SIDE\n",
    "- Notice assists - passes that immediately lead to a made basket ON EITHER SIDE\n",
