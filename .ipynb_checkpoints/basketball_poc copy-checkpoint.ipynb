    "This notebook implements a comprehensive basketball video analysis system that:\n",
    "- Processes 15-minute basketball video clips\n",
    "- Detects key events: 2pt/3pt shots, assists, steals, blocks\n",
    "- Generates structured JSON outputs and annotated videos\n",
    "- Uses Gemini Pro 2.5 for video understanding and event extraction\n",
    "- Uses FFmpeg for robust video processing\n",

    "2. **VLM Analysis**: Gemini Pro 2.5 generates dense captions for each chunk\n",
    "3. **Event Synthesis**: LLM cleans and structures events into final logs\n",

    "1. **BLOCKS** - Player deflecting/stopping opponent's shot attempt\n",
    "2. **REBOUNDS** - Player grabbing the ball after a missed shot (offensive or defensive)\n",

    "4. **SHOTS** - Shots taken from BEYOND the 3-point arc (only use this for 3-point attempts)\n",

    "CRITICAL SHOT CLASSIFICATION RULES:\n",
    "- Use \"2pt_shot\" for: layups, dunks, any shot inside the 3-point line, mid-range shots, paint shots, close-range shots\n",
    "- Use \"shot\" for: only shots taken from beyond the 3-point arc, corner threes, deep shots\n",

    "- Pay special attention to shooter position relative to the 3-point arc\n",
    "- Watch the ENTIRE segment carefully\n",
    "- Give timestamps in seconds from segment start (0-30s)\n",
    "- Use confidence 6-10 (be generous with confidence scores)\n",
